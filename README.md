# Multi Module Package Structure

    **app module**
    
    com.iapp.androidmvvm   # app Root Package
    â”œâ”€â”€ api                 # Api GET resquest header and relative info
    â”œâ”€â”€ datasource          # For data handling
    â”œâ”€â”€ model               # Model data classes mapped from api model classes
    â”œâ”€â”€ network             # Api and Client Files
    â”œâ”€â”€ respo               # Repository Files 
    â”œâ”€â”€ ui                  # UI/View layer
    â”‚ â””â”€â”€ adapters          # All Adapters 
    â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Server            # Server Activity
    â””â”€â”€ utils                # Utility Classes / Kotlin extensions / Constants/ diffUtils for recyclerViews
    â””â”€â”€ viewmodel          # Vewholder Classes
